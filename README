           Borbie's Big Adventure: Let's Hit the Town!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


LINUX BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Install required libraries:
    XCursor, OpenGL, ...

2) Build the program by typing the following into your terminal.
   NOTE: All other dependencies are pre-packaged, no need to link them. The
         Makefile should automatically build for your system (32 or 64 bit).
         Debug flags are enabled.
    $ make clean
    $ make


RUNNING THE PROGRAM (LINUX):

    Run the run script, or run the executable directly:
        $ ./run
       OR
        $ ./bin/BorbiesBigAdventure
       
    You may also run the program with a varienty of runtime flags:
        $ ./bin/BorbiesBigAdventure <-flags>
    Available flags are:
        d: debug mode (no gravity, fast movement):
            $ ./bin/BorbiesBigAdventure -d
        f: full screen mode:
            $ ./bin/BorbiesBigAdventure -f
        WARNING: full screen mode sometimes fails to reset your screen
        resolution (thanks, Irrlicht). It is recommended to instead run
        the program normally, and maximize the window.
    
    To run in debug mode, you can also use the debug run script:
        $ ./debug


OTHER PLATFORMS:

    All libraries used to implement this game, namely FMOD and Irrlicht,
    are compatible with Windows and Mac OS. However, this package does
    not provide direct solutions for installing and running the game on
    those platforms.

             CONTENT AND LIBRARY LICENCES AND INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

FMOD:   FMOD is the sound library used to implement sound in our game.
        FMOD is NOT open source, but provides a free for non-commercial
        use option for developers. This game implements FMOD under that
        agreement.

Irrlicht:   Irrlicht is open source, and available freely online. No
        restrictions there. All Irrlicht-related tools used are open source.

3D Models:  Unkown - most of the 3D models used have been scavaged online
        from a variety of resources, and we do not know the licences.

Textures:   Unkown - same as 3D models.

Sounds:     Unkown - same as 3D models. Many of the sounds used were
        released under the attribution licence, and they are NOT attributed
        in the game. We don't even have credits.

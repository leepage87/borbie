 *	AudioSystem class. This object is responsible for providing an interface
 *  wrapping the Audio library subsystem. It is responsible for abstracting
 *  the audio playback functionality within the game, allowing for 2D and 3D
 *  sounds in the virtual world, such as music or world sound effects.
 *
 *  Currently, this class uses the FMOD audio library.
 *  See doc/fmodex.pdf for full documentation on this library.
 *  Special thanks to http://www.online-convert.com for converting

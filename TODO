1)  Target castRay should return the distance, not the target, and throwing
    a car should still go in a straight line, but the calculated damage
    impact can be centralized at the target node's actual position.
2)  Take out applyExplosionDamage from GameObject, and have it be done in
    GameInstance instead - make GameInstance just apply a given amount of
    damage to all damage-able objects around a given position for a given
    max damage.
3)  CastRay distance is fine (for picking up targets), but making the ray
    slightly wider (if possible?) wouldn't hurt. Picking up cars, especially
    when they will be moving, might be annoying with such a small window
    size for clicking.
4)  For throwing cars, it would be nice to get the ray cast to determine
    the target to be wider also - that is, so you can't "accidentally" target
    a building hiding behind other buildings only visible by like 1 pixel,
    and then the throwing calculations won't figure out that there are other
    buildings in front of it through which the car flies.

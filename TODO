1)  CastRay distance is fine (for picking up targets), but making the ray
    slightly wider (if possible?) wouldn't hurt. Picking up cars, especially
    when they will be moving, might be annoying with such a small window
    size for clicking.
2)  For throwing cars, it would be nice to get the ray cast to determine
    the target to be wider also - that is, so you can't "accidentally" target
    a building hiding behind other buildings only visible by like 1 pixel,
    and then the throwing calculations won't figure out that there are other
    buildings in front of it through which the car flies.
3)  Pre-load textures for particle systems BEFORE calling them, that way
    the first explosion is actually seen by the player.
4)  Audiosystem needs channel tracking via an audio object. If you
    create an audio clip and play it in 3D, you can't stop it unless
    you release the sound out of memory right now. That sucks.
5)  Add lamps, fire hydrants, trees. Fire hydrants w/ particles may be
    hard. Low priority.
